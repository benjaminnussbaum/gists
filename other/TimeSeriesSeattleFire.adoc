== First Some Background

There has been an open data movement in government the last couple years that has been gaining momentum so I began searching http://www.data.gov and looking for other cities that have data portals. I discovered the city of Seattle has a data portal at https://data.seattle.gov/, which had a useful, large time-series dataset containing all 911 fire calls received since 2010. There were about 400k entries in the CSV containing an Address, Latitude, Longitude, Incident Type, Incident Number and Date+Time.

== Next the Data Preparation

I needed to a do a couple things to get the data into a more friendly and complete state for loading into Neo4j.
1. I removed all spaces from the column names.
2. I wanted a millisecond timestamp associated with each row in addition to the long UTC text format so I ran a process to insert a second time column that converted the Datetime string value to milliseconds and placed that value in the new DatetimeMS column.

== Originating the Time Tree

I expaned on the work done by Mark Needham in his post <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2014/04/19/neo4j-cypher-creating-a-time-tree-down-to-the-day/">Neo4j: Cypher â€“ Creating a time tree down to the day</a>

The main changes were the following:
1. I chose to use a single CONTAINS relationship going from the higher tree toward the lower tree level to simplify movement up and down the entire tree through the use of depth-based pattern matching.
2. I added hour and minute levels to the time tree.
3. I created NEXT relationships at month, day, hour and minute levels to enable rapid sequential movement at any level in the time tree instead of only the lowest.

A couple steps are required to setup the time tree with minute level precision.
First I needed to create the time tree and next connections down through the hour depth

== Loading the CSV Data

Michael Hunger has some very useful tips on using LOAD CSV with Cyhper in his post <a href="http://jexp.github.io/blog/html/load_csv_tips.html">LOAD CSV into Neo4j quickly and successfully</a>, which is a worthwile read before you begin importing your own CSV data.

==== Find account holders who share more than one piece of legitimate contact information

----
MATCH 		(accountHolder:AccountHolder)-[]->(contactInformation) 
WITH 		contactInformation, 
			count(accountHolder) AS RingSize 
MATCH 		(contactInformation)<-[]-(accountHolder) 
WITH 		collect(accountHolder.UniqueId) AS AccountHolders, 
			contactInformation, RingSize
WHERE 		RingSize > 1 
RETURN 		AccountHolders AS FraudRing, 
			labels(contactInformation) AS ContactType, 
			RingSize
ORDER BY 	RingSize DESC
